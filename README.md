We have a helper to [publishing] the site:

[publishing]: https://github.com/ENE/ENE-hugo/projects/2

```console
$ hman -h

  hman                     Points to root
       md                  To check Markdown, and points to root
       html                To check the HTML and enter into it
       commit [message]    Commit

       -h | --help         Shows these instructions

```

However edits and commits in the [cocoa-eh] theme will are done manually.
